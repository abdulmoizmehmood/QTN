# Quantum Matrix Product States (MPS) in Qiskit

## Overview

This repository contains a simple example of how to represent a quantum state using Matrix Product States (MPS) in Qiskit. MPS is a tensor network representation that allows us to efficiently describe certain quantum states. In this example, we demonstrate how to create an MPS for a given state and visualize it using Qiskit.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Qiskit library (install via `pip install qiskit`)
- Numpy library (install via `pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib library (install via `pip install matplotlib`)

## Example

The example code in this repository demonstrates how to represent the quantum state `|00⟩ + |11⟩` using MPS and visualize it as a quantum circuit. The bond dimension is set to 2 for simplicity.


## Usage

To run the example code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have installed all the required libraries mentioned in the Requirements section.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the example code.
4. Run the code to create and visualize the MPS for the state `|00⟩ + |11⟩`.

Feel free to modify the code to represent different quantum states or adjust the bond dimension to explore different MPS representations.
